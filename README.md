Build a audio recorder with Electron from scratch. 

Watch the [Electron 8 Tutorial](https://youtu.be/3yqDxhR2XxE) on YouTube. 

## Aim of this Project

The aim of this project is to record user's audio using microphone and user should be able to start, pause and stop his recording.

__Additional Feature:__ Users have the option to download and save his recordings. List of User's recording is also being shown in the form of list.

## Approach

Created one render process for audio media accessibility and control buttons functionality.

## Project Guide

### Framework used
1. Bulma - for css styling
